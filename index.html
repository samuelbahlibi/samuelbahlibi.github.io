            <p>
                I am currently seeking a position as a full-time Front-End Developer, or as a Product Manager. I am forever a student. I love to learn, keeping myself up to date with new algorithms and new languages. I know Java, HTML5, CSS3 and Git very well. I also know Javascript, C++, Python, and am teaching myself Node, SQL, and Swift. I also enjoy testing my knowledge on algorithms using LeetCode. It opens my eyes to different problem-solving strategies that I can apply with my own projects. Aside from coding, I really enjoy cooking and rock climbing. <br> Below youâ€™ll find links to my Linkedin, my Github and my resume.

                <p>
                    I've always been in love with Graphic Design since I was a child. Over time I've developed my skills and gained an eye for design. I've designed everything from apparel, to logos and everything in between. I like to utilize my eye for design to create visually appealing websites.

                <p>
                    Since design came naturally to me, it's only fitting that I love web development. The two go hand in hand. I have experience in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. That doesn't mean I'll stop there, I plan on understanding and applying other languages to my tool belt.

                <h1>Product Management</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a planner. In my eyes nothing can be accomplished without a vision and a road map to the finish line. I try to start with all the things I need to know. This gives me an idea of what needs to be done in the short term. Then I like to plan sprints for myself till I finish what's needed.

                    Gator Trade offers San Francisco State University students and faculty a convenient way to post and access media pertaining to their classes and other activities through a web client service called Gator Trade.

                <p>
                    The first website I designed was for my CSC 412 class. It was an advanced web development class that taught me the basics of HTML, CSS and PHP. What I completed was the final project to the class where I used the bootstrapped framework. I also found out about AoS and implemented it. My biggest challenge was trying to understand padding and a responsive website. This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of CSS3 and HTML5 as well as brushing up on my JavaScript skills.

                <h1>Tank Wars</h1>
                <p>
                    This was my first project exploring Java packages. I created a two player split screen game utilizing JSwing. There was a lot of challenges in building this project, but the biggest challenge was implementing collision elements. I learned a lot, specifically about polymorphism and how classed can be utilized to inherit functions from parent classes. I also learned how to be more organized with my code. Previously, with school assignments code was written out in a single file with a main class, but in this aspect I used multiple child classes to focus on reusability.

                <p>
                    CodeComp is a competitive platform for people who dislike leetcode and want to practice in a competitive nature. Users load up a lobby to face off in a head to head battle on increasingly difficult coding problems. I joined a team of developers to create this paltform using Node.JS and SASS for the front end. I'm in charge of creating the User Profiles that will be applied to every person who registers. The project is currently in development and we're aiming for deployment in the Winter.
